# Physical Data-guided Machine Learning
PDgML is a supervised DL model that statistically learns the known or unknown physics of a desired phenomenon by extracting features or attributes from raw training data. PDgML consists of one or a combination of deep neural networks (DNN)~\cite{lecun2015deep}, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs),  generative adversarial networks (GAN), graph neural networks (GNN), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), Transfomer, deep operator networks, and physics-discovery neural networks.
